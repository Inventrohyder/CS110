    "# Plagiarism detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plagiarism** is the use of another's work and ideas as if they are one's original work. For many institutions, it is a habit that is highly discouraged. In the case of an educational institution, we would want to identify cases of plagiarism so that students can receive a stick for such a habit and thereby discouraging them. However, being in the realm of natural language (with changing rules), the detection of plagiarism is a much more formidable problem than it seems at first. Therefore, in this report, we will look at a method that implements a machine learning algorithm so that as the data of users evolve, so will the detection techniques."

    "If we have two student submissions, _\" today is Monday\"_ and _\"day\"_, concatenating all the words and converting it to lower case, we can point out common substrings of length k (_k-gram_). In this case, if `k` is 3, then the possible (i, j) positions of matches in the first and second strings are (2, 0) and (10, 0). \n",
