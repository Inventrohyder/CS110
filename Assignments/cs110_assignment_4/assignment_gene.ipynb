    "1. Your **first resource** should be a PDF file created from the Jupyter notebook template provided in these instructions. If your name is “Dumbledore”, your PDF should be named “Dumbledore.pdf”. **For best results, follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJbsx0r2Kh0VsmF_t_q84awPK-88yZlK8nO7pHWtFBA/edit?usp=sharing) to convert the Jupyter Notebook to a PDF. Regardless of the method you choose, make sure that, in your PDF submission, texts can be selected/ highlighted.**\n",
    "2. Your **second resource** must be a single Jupyter Notebook named “Dumbledore.ipynb”. Alternatively, you can also submit a zip file that includes your Jupyter notebook, but please make sure to name it “Dumbledore.zip” (the Jupyter notebook submitted as part of such zip file should still be named “Dumbledore.ipynb”!).\n",

Please refer to [these guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7yOVOtMIaHQdKLeRmZbq1gRqwJKfezBsfru9Q6PcHw/edit) on how to incorporate HCs in your work.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "Gene Mutation is a prevailing and computationally intensive research topic in Genetics. For this assignment, assume that you have been hired by a biotechnology company to work on a gene mutation research project, and your first task is to write a Python program to investigate a genealogical mutation sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, a gene is described by a string of letters, with a letter being chosen from the set ${A, C, G, T}$. A mutation is relatively rare but it can occur in which there is a small probability of either inserting a new character, deleting an existing character, or changing to a new character randomly. We can refer to these probabilities by $p_i, p_d$, and $p_c$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose the starting point is a given string that undergoes a mutation process. This mutation created two other strings, the child strings of the first string. Each of these two new strings can undergo mutations by which they will change from their parent. In turn, the two-child strings, mutate and create 2 new substrings each, resulting in four grandchild strings from the original gene sequencing string. We can easily visualize the sequence of mutations if we were to draw a genealogy binary tree relating strings to their parent and grandparent strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these mutations, we now have 7 strings but unfortunately, the order of the strings has been lost due to a glitch in the gene sequencing generation program. Therefore, your first task in the project is to recover the genealogy tree for the following set of 7 strings labelled with lowercase letters:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "('a', 'AGTTATGTGTCAGAGCAAAAGATTCCTCATCTAGCGGTCGCAAGTCATTGCC'),\n",
    "('b', 'AAGTTATTTGCTCACAGGGAACGAATCCAGCTCTGCGGTCGAGGCCACATTGCC'),\n",
    "('c', 'AGTTATTTTCAGAGAAATGATTCCTTCTCACCGGTCGAGCCAGTGCC'),\n",
    "('d', 'AGTTTATGTGTCAGAAGCAAAAGATTACTAATCTACGCGTCGCAAGGTCTATTCC'),\n",

    "('g', 'AGTTATGTGTCACAGGCAAAAGATCCTTCTCTGCGGTCGAACCCATTGCC')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Henceforth, the set of strings created with the gene-sequencing generation program will be referred to as `Set_Strings`.\n",
