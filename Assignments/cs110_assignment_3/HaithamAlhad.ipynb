    "After learning about hashing functions and techniques, we will be exploring an implementation of such techniques called bloom filters. Firstly we will briefly discuss the [standard bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter), then improve upon it using [counting bloom filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_Bloom_filter).\n",

    "According to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) a [bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) is \"a space-efficient probabilistic data structure\" conceived by [Burton Howard Bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Howard_Bloom) in 1970 that \"tests whether an element is a member of a set\". ([Bloom Filters - Geeks for Geeks][geeksforgeeks]\n",

    "James Graham, an engineer at Medium, mentions that they are a quick way of \"answering a YES/NO question\". Although  in programming, we always have to work with _trade-offs_. They will \"very rarely say YES when the answer is NO, but they will never say NO when the answer is actually YES\".([What are Bloom filters?][medium]). Since they are probabilistic the more items we add into a bloom filter the higher the chance of getting a _false positive_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a normal hash table it is an array of $m$ bits, initiated with all zeros, and requires $k$ hash functions to insert an element. The hash functions reveal the slots that are flipped from 0 to 1 during insertion of an element.\n",
