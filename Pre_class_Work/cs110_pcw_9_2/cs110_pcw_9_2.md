# Pre-class Work - Lesson 9.2

## Question 1 (Exercise 13.1-3 Cormen et al.)

**Let us define a relaxed red-black tree as a binary search tree that satisfies red-black properties 1, 3, 4, and 5. In
other words, the root may be either red or black. Consider a relaxed red-black tree T whose root is red. If we color
the root of T black but make no other changes to T , is the resulting tree a red-black tree?**

## Question 2. (Exercise 13.1-4 Cormen et al.)

**Suppose that we “absorb” every red node in a red-black tree into its black parent, so that the children of the red
node become children of the black parent. (Ignore what happens to the keys.) What are the possible degrees of a
black node after all its red children are absorbed?**

## Question 3. (Exercise 13.1-5 Cormen et al.)

**Show that the longest simple path from a node x in a red-black tree to a descendant leaf has length at most twice
that of the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf.**

## Question 4. (Exercise 13.1-6 Cormen et al.)

**What is the largest possible number of internal nodes in a red-black tree with blackheight k? What is the smallest
possible number?**

## Question 5. Left-Right Balance

**We can define the left-right balance of a binary search tree as the ratio of the number of nodes in the left subtree
to the number of nodes in the right. Answer the following questions:**

1. **If a BST can be successfully colored red-black, then find bounds on the left-right balance of that tree, or prove
why there is no bound on the left-right balance of that tree.**

2. **Does your answer change as the number of nodes in the tree increases? Explain.**
